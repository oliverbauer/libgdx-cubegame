# libgdx-cubegame

A small example game to learn libGDX. Environment: Eclipse / Linux / Apache Maven (No Gradle, No Windows, No Android). 
There is no music/soundfiles pushed but it should work without.

**How to run the game**:

Import Maven Project in Eclipse and run CubeGame.java

Inputs: Keyboard: W,A,S,D for cube movement, Q,R for cam rotation. Mouse: Zoom, rotatation of the board.

Some things could be changed only due to changes in Sourcecode (e.g. Cubemap instead of fixed background image, see Config.java).

The initial example (from 2020.09.12) took approx 6 weeks of development in my free time (after work / holiday / weekend). Most time consuming was 
controlling the cube with WASD... maybe this example helps someone (but be warned: Sourcecode is not beautiful).
